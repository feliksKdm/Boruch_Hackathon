🎓 EduRisk AI – Backend API

A FastAPI backend service that serves a trained machine learning model to predict student academic outcomes and dropout risk.

This API powers the EduRisk AI Early Warning System, enabling real-time prediction for:

🎯 Predicted Outcome: Dropout / Enrolled / Graduate

📊 Dropout Risk Score (0–100%)

🔎 Confidence Score

📈 Probability distribution across all classes

📂 Batch CSV processing

🚀 Overview

This backend exposes two main endpoints:

Endpoint	Method	Description
/predict	POST	Predict outcome for a single student
/predict_csv	POST	Upload CSV file and receive predictions file

The API loads a trained multi-class XGBoost model saved as:

student_success_multiclass.pkl

The pipeline includes:

Column normalization (snake_case)

Feature engineering

Risk Scoring Formula

Dropout Risk Score:

𝑅
𝑖
𝑠
𝑘
=
𝑃
(
𝐷
𝑟
𝑜
𝑝
𝑜
𝑢
𝑡
)
×
100
Risk=P(Dropout)×100

Risk Levels (frontend logic):

🟢 Low: 0–40%

🟠 Medium: 40–70%

🔴 High: 70–100%

🏷 Feature Engineering

The API automatically creates derived features:

Approval Rate
=
approved
enrolled
Approval Rate=
enrolled
approved
	​

Success Ratio
=
approved
evaluations
Success Ratio=
evaluations
approved
	​

No Evaluation Rate
=
without evaluations
enrolled
No Evaluation Rate=
enrolled
without evaluations
	​


This ensures consistency between training and inference.
